# karatsuba

Multiplying two large numbers can be hard in order to size of number can exceed the borders of the integer types. 
Also to apply the efficient way, handling with large numbers can increase running time and cost and decrease efficiency, too.

While solving this multiplication problem I implemented two algorithms using string format.
First algorithm is classical Method and the second one is karatsuba algorithm.
